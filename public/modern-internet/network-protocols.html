			<h1>Current Network Protocols</h1>
			<br>
			<p><h3>Network Protocol is a set of rules that rule communications between computers on a network. This page will discuss some of the common protocols that the common computer user is likely to use.</h3></p>
			<br>
			<h3>TCP/IP</h3>
			<br>
			<p>These two different procedures are often linked together, which is very common since the functions of the different protocols can complement each other so that they can carry out a task efficiently and completely. The TCP/IP is what carries out the basic operations of the Web and is used on many LANs or Local Area Networks. When information is sent over the Internet,  it is generally broken up into smaller pieces or "packets". The use of these packets make transmission of data faster. It is also safer sincce it minimizes loss of information in the transmission process. TCP also puts these sent packets back together in the correct order, while checking that there are no packets that got lost during the process.</p>
			<br>
			<p>IP is the method to send information to the proper address with the use of IP addresses. Every computer on the Internet has to have its own unique IP address. Every packet sent has an IP address showing where it is supposed to go.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>UDP and ICMP</h3>
			<br>
			<p>Another member of the TCP/IP suite is User Datagram Protocol (UDP). This is used together with IP when small amounts of information are involved. However, it lacks the flow-control and error-recovery functions of the TCP, thus uses fewer system resources.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) defines a small number of messages used for diagnostic and management purposes.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Mail Protocols POP3 and SMTP</h3>
			<br>
			<p>The most common protocol for sending mail is Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) and the most common protocol used by PCs for receving mail is Post Office Protocol (POP), which is now in version 3, thus called POP3. These protocols both use TCP for managing the transmission and delivery of mail across the Internet.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</h3>
			<br>
			<p>An HTML page is communicated over the Web in a standard format known as Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). This uses the TCP/IP to manage Web Transmission.</p>
			<br>
			<p>There are many more protocols used over the Internet today and these are just some of the few.</p>
