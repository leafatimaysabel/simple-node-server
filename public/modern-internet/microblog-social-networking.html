			<h1>Social Networking and Microblogging</h1>
			<h4><p>Social networking has gained breathtaking worldwide popularity. Use of these sites vary from teenagers to young adults, and sometimes even older adults still use this site from time to time! It has been known that these sites are impacting the lives of people greatly. In 1979, the first internet service to allow the exchange of emails was made. It was named "Compuserve". While hundreds of thousands of users hung out in these digital forums, the rest of us would have to wait for easier and convenient social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter, as we know them today. In 2004, the most popular site on the web besides Google, which was named "Facebook" was made. In 2006, a micro-blogging site complete with #hashtags and @tagging was made, with a limit to 140 characters per post. It's name was "Twitter". Since these 2 major social networking sites, other sites followed through like Pinterest, Instagram, YouTube, etc.</p>

			<p>Aside from blogs, what's more popular these days are microblogs. These are broadcast media that exists in the form of blogging. It differs from a blog in such a way that its content is typically smaller in both actual and aggregated file size. Its immediacy and portability are its key features. Posts are brief (typically 140-200 characters) and can be written or received with a variety of computing devices. Microblogging is also very useful. Take for example what U.S. President Barack Obama did. He microblogged from the campaign trail using Twitter, one of the most popular microblogging services of today. With the advent of microblogging, news and other information have been taken to the next level.</p></h4>
