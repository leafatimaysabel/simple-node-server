			<h1>Blogging</h1>
			<br>
			<h3><p>Blogs are a big part of the Internet. Everyone reads blogs now, whether they are legit sources of information associated with news and media, one's work or hobbies, entertainment, you name it.</p>
			<br>
			<p>It wasn't until 1997 that the term "weblog" was coined. This was created to reflect the process of "logging the web" as he browsed. It was shorted to "blog" in 1999 by programmer Peter Merholz. Originally, the blogs were updated manually which was not very efficient at first. By the middle of 2006, there were 50 million blogs over the internet.</p>
			<br>
			<p>With the advent of blogging, microblogs and Tumblelogs also lived up to the hype. Blogs have become only a part of an individual's persona. There's still a lot of room for growth and innovation in these blogs and we cannot see them going anywhere in the future.</p></h3>
