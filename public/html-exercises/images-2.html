        <h1>The Long and Winding Road of My Life</h1>
        <br>
        <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/"><img src="images/DSC_0029 (3).JPG" style="float:left;width:80px;height:80px;"></a> The best years of one's life are her childhood days. The sweet memories of this phase makes me very sentimental once in a while. My childhood is an awesome one, even though my parents were very strict, since I am an only girl. I already have my curfew, my schedule for studying, for playing outside, and for other activities. Nevertheless, I still enjoyed it and made the most out of it. During those times, my only responsibilities were to study, eat and sleep on time. I love the carefree feeling of being a child. I also loved to travel and see new places since I was a kid. Also, sports already started to be a great part of my life then.

So many things happened in highschool. It helped me to nurture my dreams, have an open mind about everything that I hear and most of all, develop my skills for socialization. I also started to make decisions for myself, little ones, of course. Still, my mom and dad were always the ones to decide. They always know better, though sometimes I cannot see that. I studied in a catholic high school. It was quite hard, since the regulations were very strictly implemented. I really did want to study there at first, but since my other siblings graduated there, I had no choice but to follow their foot steps. In the end, I did enjoyed highschool and right now, I just miss my HS friends. :(

I, for one, imagined myself having high grades and graduating with latin honors (ambitious eh?). But right now, I can say that imagining things is one easy job, fulfilling them is another. Later did I realize that college life is a tough road to success. Right now, I am a year delayed in my studies, and I'm not going to graduate with latin honors for sure. I also did not imagined myself entering an organization because that was not my priority at first. But as they say, the only permanent thing in this life is change. Luckily, I was able to embrace it and make the most out of it. I'm hoping right now to finish my studies as soon as possible because I know have a long way to go.

Since I was a little girl, I have dreamed of me in a full white coat, attending to patients and doing the best I can to help them with their sickness. Right now, I am fulfilling it. Hopefully, after 6 or 7 years, I will be graduating from my dream medical school, finally achieving my ultimate goal in life: to help people who are in need through the use of medicine.
