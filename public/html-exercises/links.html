		<h2>A List of My Favorites</h2>
		
		<h3><em>My Top 3 Movies</em></h3>
		<p>My top third favorite movie is <a href="http://www.lordoftherings.net/">Lord of the Rings Trilogy</a> because it is just amazing. It really captured the essence of the story in the book. It was an enthusiastic imagination set on loose on one of the greatest playgrounds ever made. Every installment just seems to get me excited for the next one. This trilogy is 10 hours worth of fun-filled adventure that could take you to places you have never seen before.</p>
		<p>My second top favorite is <a href="http://wwws.warnerbros.co.uk/theprestige/">The Prestige</a>. If you are looking for a movie that can amaze you and can leave your mouth open, this is the movie you are looking for. A movie that revolves around two great magicians who became rivals. The story is set in the 19th century and I just love the ambience of the 19th century. They were both obsessed with perfecting a magic trick on stage that they took this rivalry to a personal level, a scene that often happens in our daily lives. I also love the concept of family here, because I myself is a family-oriented person. Plus, Hugh Jackman never fails me.</p>
		<p>My favorite movie of all time is <a href="http://www.starwars.com/">Star Wars</a>. Yes, do I really have to explain this one? Star Wars is an amazing film series set on space. YES, SPACE, how awesome is that? I always love how they have this narrative in the beginning of what happened. I know George Lucas had several difficulties in directing the films but nevertheless, he pulled it off with his visionary. And of course, who doesn't even know about the lightsaber, the weapons of the Jedi and the Sith? I had dreamt of getting one since I watched the movies. It can literally cut through anything, even your feet. (Oops, spoiler alert.)</p>

		<h3><em>My Top 3 Songs</em></h3>
		<p>The third spot goes to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hT_nvWreIhg">Counting Stars</a> by OneRepublic. The beat just gets me. I think this is one of OneRepublic's greatest singles ever. It's amazing how a pop song can be combined with a folk-like sound or element.</p>
		<p>The second spot goes to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIjVuRTm-dc">She Will Be Loved</a> by Maroon 5. Maroon 5 is one of my favorite bands ever. I just love how they make every song popular, especially this one. Adam Levine has not only a hot voice but was blessed with a hot body as well. Too bad he's already married now.</p>
		<p>My most played music on my playlist is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KVxjQUCyn0">Thank God I Found You</a> by Mariah Carey, Joe and 98 Degrees. This song is too emotional, but I just love each line of it. This is the song I will sing when I have found "the one" in the far, far away future.</p>
