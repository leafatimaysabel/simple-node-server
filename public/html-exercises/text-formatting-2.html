        <h1>It's all about ME! :)</h1>
        <p>My full name is <strong>Lea Fatima Ysabel E. Orias</strong>, <em>Lea</em> for short.
        I was born on the 27th of October 1995 in Mandaluyong Medical Center.
        Batch 2011, Bachelor of Science in Nutrition. Currently taking CMSC 2 as an elective. One thing that can define me is <strong>sports</strong>. 
        I love sports so much that it became half of my life. Swimming is my favorite sport, thus my tan lines. ;)</p>

        <p>I studied highschool in <abbr title="St. Jude Academy">SJA</abbr> in our hometown, Cavite City. I am currently having my undergraduate degree at the prestigious University of the Philippines Los Banos in
        Los Banos, Laguna. In my almost 4-years stay in <abbr title="University of the Philippines Los Banos">UPLB</abbr>, I have heard so many great sayings, but my favorite quote is: <em><q>There is no other way but UP.</q></em> because it is just the truth.
        I'm studying here because I know it can bring me towards my goals in life. I am also a fan of books. I love the <cite>Harry Potter</cite> by the famous JK Rowling, <cite>Gone Girl</cite> by Gillian Flynn and <cite>Tuesdays with Morrie</cite>
        by Mitch Albom. Well, basically any book by Mitch Albom is good enough for me.</p>
