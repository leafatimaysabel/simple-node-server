					<h1>The World Wide Web</h1>
					<p>The Web is a beautiful service that operates over the internet. The term is often mistakenly used as a synonym for the word Internet itself.  There were different precursors to the invention of the World Wide Web. In 1980, Sir Tim Berners-Lee, an engineer at CERN, built ENQUIRE, as a personal dabatase of people and software models, but also as a way to play with hypertext. This is when each new page of information in ENQUIRE was linked to an existing page.</p> 
					<br>
					<p>It was this man who brought all the necessary components together and created the World Wide Web. The first trials of this World Wide Web were at the CERN laboratories by December 1990. The first browser which became popularly available to take advantage of this was Mosaic in 1993. Mosaic was terribly slow and couldn't handle downloading pictures well at all. The experience was awful and didn't give much indication of the potential of the World Wide Web as we know it today.</p>
					<br>
					<p>On April 30, 1993, CERN's directors stated that WWW technology would be freely usable by anyone, no fees payable to CERN or any other institute. This really began to change everything. By the end of 1994, there were a million browser copies in use.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Things developed faster than anyone could ever imagine. Some changes even affected the way traditional markets worked. Life would never be the same again without the World Wide Web.</p>
