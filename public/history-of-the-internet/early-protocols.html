					<h1>Early Protocols</h1>
					<p>The internet based protocols were mainly conceived between the 1970s and 1980s. Initially, we have the ARPAnet whose purpose was to relay information between various mainframe computers across the country. It eventually grew over the years, allowing more universities and other organizations to join the network. In order for messages to be passed along this network, an addressing system was needed. Eventually, the method which became the standard was a series of protocols known as the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol or the TCP/IP.</p>
					<br>
					<p>The Transmission Control Protocol offers an intermediary between applications looking to send data over the Internet and the IP packets; rather than an application having to break its data into packets with proper formatting and collision/signal loss detection, TCP handles all of that, allowing applications to simply send and receive data. The Internet Protocol is the meat of modern networked communications. IP works by creating a packet of information containing a header and the data being sent. The header includes information such as the destination and, optionally, what servers to route through on the way to the destination. It also includes the source address for the message and any other information required, such as “TTL,” or Time To Live, a timer that tells a server when it can ignore a packet coming in as having taken too long to reach its destination.</p>
					<br>
					<p>The TCP/IP stands out because it enables heterogeneous networking. It also has a good failure recovery, the ability to add networks without interrupting existing services and high error-rate handling. Because the TCP/IP was originally designed for the Department of Defense-related purposes, what we now call features were actually design requirements.</p>
