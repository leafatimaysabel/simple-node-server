					<h1>The World War II Era</h1>
					<p>Computers were not a new concept anymore during the World War II. Most of the advances in computer that time were related to radar and battlefield communication because of the war. It was in fact, government activities that led to the development of the internet. On October 4, 1957, the Soviets launched Sputnik, man’s first attempt into outer space.</p>
					<br>
					<p>This caused the U.S. Government to subsequently launch a hostile military campaign to surpass the doings of the Soviet. The launch of Sputnik and other related activities by the U.S.S.R. led to the birth of the ARPA or the Advanced Research Projects Agency. At first, the nature of the activity of the ARPA was all about space and strategic missile research, but when NASA or the National Aeronautics and Space Administration was made, ARPA became more focused on computer science and information processing.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Its goal back then was to connect mainframe computers at different universities around the country so that they would be able to communicate using a common language and a common protocol. Thus, the ARPAnet, the world’s first computer network, was created in 1969.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Communication was a hard thing back then. Early computers were isolated devices that requires a lot of physical effort to share data. But some people see that this kind of communication could be improved. Let’s take for example Vannevar Bush, a part of the Defense Research Committee during the World War II. Bush had envisioned an automatic device that could manage all the enormous amounts of information we generate every day. His idea would soon inspire other computer scientists to find a way to make this more organized and effective.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Eventually, technological developments caught up and the U.S. Department of Defense’s plan to create a wide area network that would allow different computers running various operating systems to share information between them empowered further progress. A man named J.C.R. Licklider also saw the need for a new approach to managing information. He acknowledged the problem that data processing and sorting information was not efficient enough and took about 85 percent of the time he dedicated to completing such tasks. These brilliant minds provided the foundation for the next engineers and scientists to build the ARPAnet.</p>
